			<h3>Stories</h3>
			<p>Diana was created by her mother Hippolyta out of clay and was granted life by the Greek pantheon. This made Diana unique as she was the only Amazon without a biological father. Diana was once a member of the Amazon tribe living on Paradise Island, an isolated community where the women were trained as warriors and no man had set foot on the island. One day, a pilot named Steve Trevor crash landed on the island where Diana and other Amazons tended to his wounds. Diana fell in love with him when she helped him heal and decided she wanted to follow him into Man's World (in other words, the world outside of Paradise Island)</p>

			<h3>Powers</h3>
			<p>Wonder Woman's powers are drawn from certain traits of Greek goddesses, who created her. Her physical feats are impressive, with her strength, flight, stamina, speed and endurance allow her to easily overpower Kryptonians with nothing but her godlike strength. She is also invulnerable, but her weaknesses are projectiles. Examples of this are projectiles which can harm her are arrows and bullets. However, because she has speed and reflexes that are honed to perfection, she can deflect these with her bracelets</p>
